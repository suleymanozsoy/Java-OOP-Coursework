# ☕ Java & Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Journey

This repository documents my progress in the **Java & OOP** course by **Akın Kaldıroğlu**, running parallel to my academic studies as a **Computer Engineering Freshman** at **Marmara University**.

## 🎯 My Goal
To master Java fundamentals, JVM architecture, and core OOP principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction) from top-tier resources and apply them in real-world scenarios.

## 📂 Curriculum & Assignments

### 🔹 Chapter 02: Java Fundamentals
Focused on understanding Java's logic, naming conventions, and basic syntax.

- [x] **Homework-I:** Oracle Java Tutorials review and local environment setup.
- [x] **Homework-II:** Correcting naming errors in `NamingProblems` class based on **Clean Code** principles.
- [x] **Homework-III:** CLI compilation practices without package structures (`Hello.java` & `HelloTest.java`).
- [x] **Homework-IV:** Practice with `main` method, variables, and basic arithmetic (`Deneme` class).
- [x] **Homework-V:** Solved OCA (Oracle Certified Associate) Chapter 1 review questions.
- [x] **Homework-VI:** Analyzed OCA/OCP Chapter 1 & 6 practice test questions.

### 🔹 Chapter 03: Variables, Primitive Types & Scope
Deep dive into state management, type casting, and variable lifecycle.

- [x] **Homework-I (Car Logic):**
  - Created `Car` and `CarTest` classes.
  - Implemented `accelerate` and `go` methods to calculate time based on distance/speed.
- [x] **Homework-II (Variables & Scope):**
  - Created `Variables` class to test local variables without initialization.
  - Analyzed compiler errors regarding uninitialized variables.
- [x] **Homework-III (Block Scope):**
  - Experimented with code blocks `{ }` to understand variable visibility and scope.
  - Refactored variable names to follow naming conventions.
- [x] **Homework-IV (Type Casting):**
  - Created `Casts` class to implement **Narrowing** (double -> int) and **Widening** (int -> double) conversions.
  - Observed data loss during manual casting.
- [x] **Homework-V (Final Keyword):**
  - Applied `final` keyword to `Car` attributes to observe immutability rules.
- [x] **Homework-VI (OCA Prep - Building Blocks):**
  - [x] Easy: Q3, Q4, Q12, Q15, Q16
  - [x] Medium: Q17
  - [x] Hard: Q19
- [x] **Homework-VII (OCA/OCP Prep - Java Basics):**
  - [x] Easy: Q10, Q14
  - [x] Medium: Q25, Q37
  - [x] Hard: Q22, Q46, Q50
        
### 🔹 Chapter 04: Operators
Focusing on arithmetic, logical, and relational operators, operator precedence, and code readability.

- [x] **Homework-I (Operators Lab):**
  - Created `Operators` class to practice arithmetic logic.
  - Implemented **Compound Assignments** (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`).
  - Demonstrated the difference between **Pre-increment** (`++i`) and **Post-increment** (`i++`).
  - Applied **Short-Circuit** logical operators (`&&`, `||`) vs standard operators (`&`, `|`).
- [x] **Homework-II (Refactoring & Clean Code):**
  - Refactored a complex, nested **Ternary Operator** (`? :`) one-liner into a readable `if-else` block.
  - Focused on code maintainability and logic clarity.
- [x] **Homework-III (OCA Prep - Building Blocks & Operators):**
  - [x] Easy: Q1, Q2, Q4, Q10, Q11, Q14
  - [x] Medium: Q8
  - [x] Hard: Q7, Q12
- [x] **Homework-IV (OCA/OCP Prep - Practice Tests):**
  - [x] Easy: Q14, Q16, Q17, Q21, Q22, Q23, Q29, Q33, Q39, Q48
  - [x] Medium: Q2, Q3, Q26, Q30, Q31, Q35, Q36, Q37, Q40, Q41, Q42, Q43, Q47
  - [x] Hard: Q8, Q9, Q19, Q20, Q25, Q27, Q44, Q50
